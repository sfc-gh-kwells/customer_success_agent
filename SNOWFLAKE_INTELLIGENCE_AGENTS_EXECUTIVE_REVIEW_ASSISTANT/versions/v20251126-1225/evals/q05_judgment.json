    "relevance": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The case studies focus on email marketing optimization through personalization, analytics, and cross-channel integration, though some examples lean more heavily on broader messaging strategies rather than email-specific optimization."
    },
    "completeness": {
      "score": 4,
      "justification": "The response covers major aspects of email marketing optimization including personalization, analytics, segmentation, and cross-channel integration, but could include more about subject line optimization and A/B testing."

      "score": 3,
      "justification": "While the response identifies key strategies like predictive analytics and personalization, it lacks specific implementation steps or concrete metrics that would make it more actionable for readers."
    },

      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The case studies lack specific metrics, ROI data, or concrete performance improvements. Most examples are descriptive rather than quantitative."

    "synthesis": {
      "score": 5,
